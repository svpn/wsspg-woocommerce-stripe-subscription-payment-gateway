/**
 * Wsspg Uninstall
 *
 * Fired when the plugin is uninstalled ( i.e. deleted ).
 *
 * Removes options and/or settings specific to the plugin, or other database values that need to be removed.
 *
 * - This method should be static
 * - Check if the $_REQUEST content actually is the plugin name
 * - Run an admin referrer check to make sure it goes through authentication
 * - Verify the output of $_GET makes sense
 * - Repeat with other user roles. Best directly by using the links/query string parameters.
 * - Repeat things for multisite. Once for a single site in the network, once sitewide.
